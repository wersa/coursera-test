		<p>Lasagne originated in Italy during the Middle Ages and have traditionally been ascribed to the city of Naples. The first recorded recipe was set down in the early 14th-century Liber de Coquina (The Book of Cookery). It bore only a slight resemblance to the later traditional form of lasagne, featuring a fermented dough flattened into thin sheets (lasagne), boiled, sprinkled with cheese and spices, and then eaten with a small pointed stick. Recipes written in the century following the Liber de Coquina recommended boiling the pasta in chicken broth and dressing it with cheese and chicken fat. In a recipe adapted for the Lenten fast, walnuts were recommended.</p>

		<p>Ravioli is a filled pasta encasing a variety of fillings from meats to cheeses to vegetables. Early versions of the pasta can be traced as far back as the Roman Empire, although it wasnâ€™t until the Middle Ages that the ravioli we know today was first developed. In Emilia-Romagna ravioli are typically filled with ricotta e spinaci (ricotta and spinach), whereas in the small region of Molise, ravioli scapolesi is filled with sausage and chard. In northern Italy pumpkin ravioli is a popular pasta dish served in winter, traditionally eaten on Christmas Eve.</p>

		<p>The word gnocchi may be derived from the Italian word nocchio, meaning a knot in wood, or from nocca, meaning knuckle. It has been a traditional type of Italian pasta since Roman times. It was introduced by the Roman legions during the expansion of the empire into the countries of the European continent. In Roman times, gnocchi were made from a semolina porridge-like dough mixed with eggs, and are still found in similar forms today, particularly the oven-baked gnocchi alla romana and Sardinia's malloreddus which do not contain eggs.</p>
